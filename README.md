## My process

### Built with

* Semantic **HTML5** structure
* **CSS3** features including transitions, flexbox, and media queries
* **Local Figtree font** loaded with `@font-face`
* A responsive design that adapts smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop

### What I learned

During this project, I practiced:

* Hosting and using **local fonts** in web projects
* Implementing **smooth hover transitions** for better user experience
* Structuring clean, scalable CSS with well-organized sections
* Writing **responsive rules** to handle layout and text scaling

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to:

* Add JavaScript for dark/light mode toggling
* Animate the card’s entry with simple fade-in effects
* Experiment with CSS Grid layouts for more complex UI cards
